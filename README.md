# Text-Generation-Charles-Dickens

I improved Udacity's character-wise RNN to generate text similar to that of Charles Dickens. The parameters were adjusted to build a larger network, more text was used (I used 5 versus their 1), and the LSTM cells were changed to GRU. These alterations significantly reduced the validation loss and improved the quality of the generated text.

The .txt files contains the five books that I used:
- A Tale of Two Cities 
- Great Expectations
- Oliver Twist
- David Copperfield
- A Christmas Carol

If you would like to work with my code, I apologize, but I am not able to upload my checkpoints, because their file size is too large, even after being compressed.
